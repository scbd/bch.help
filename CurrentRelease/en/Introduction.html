<P>Hello trainers! By the time you are reading this manual you must be all ready to go and start preparing for the training. We will try only to temper your enthusiasm and hopefully by the end of this manual provide you an insight into the sort of training workshop that you will be delivering. We have tried to make this as much as possible, a working document. In doing so you will notice we have limited our writing and tried to give as many examples and tips that could help you in conducting a good workshop. These are our experiences not just in conducting a BCH Training workshop but from experiences in other training scenarios.</P>
<P>You might feel that there are some repetitions or that some areas have been covered more than once. Please bear with us, we have tried to keep to a strict structure and therefore in the process have included some over-lapping parts. We also recommend that you follow the manual from the beginning to the end and do not skip sections, although at times you might feel that there is no need to do so. They do follow a logical pattern.</P>
<P>Almost all sections include presentations and documents that are mean more as examples or contents repositories than fixed material to be directly deployed. You, as the only person directly in contact with your specific audience and having the knowledge about the actual situation, would adapt all those contents to your specific needs, in order to reach your objectives.</P>
<P>Finally, we believe that this manual is only a tool and therefore should be treated as such. It should only be an addition to the various tools that you already possess and is not the end-all for all training issues. Feel free to make comments on it and give your views on how we can improve this manual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
