<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000000>Modules Teaching and Learning Methodology </FONT></STRONG><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Introduction</STRONG> </FONT></P>
<P>This section intends to give some general guidelines about setting up a standardized methodology for devising and planning each one of the Modules that comprise a Training Workshop.</P>
<P>Here we will consider the following activities:</P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>General guidelines for module definition 
<LI>Evaluation 
<LI>Teaching and Module Assessment </LI></UL></UL>
<P><A name=_Toc127080068></A><A name=_Toc126426204></A><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>General guidelines for module definition</STRONG> </FONT></P>
<P>Every course and every individual subject or topic inside a course should clearly state what are the objectives, what will be the methods and tools used to teach and learn, and what will be achieved at the end of the module. After completing the course, there should be some means of assessing, if the objectives have been met, and if not, there should be some kind of standard action to correct the situation. Assessment or evaluation, (in its most broad sense-interpretation) serves this purpose.</P>
<P><A name=_Toc127080069></A><A name=_Toc126426205></A><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Suggested sections for each module</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>The following is a draft about what would be a standard layout for every module or topic in a standard Workshop. The following sections should be represented in the corresponding documents and also be the general guidelines to conduct the module training.</P>
<P><STRONG>1. Introduction </STRONG></P>
<P>General info about the module</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000000>2. Module or Topic Objective</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Clearly state the Objective(s) of the module. Standard way is using a phrase like: <I>"at the end of the module participants <STRONG>will be able to …</STRONG> (concrete skills)...”</I></P>
<P>So this very objective leads immediately to focusing on the contents, and clearly defines what should be asked in order to assess if the objective has been reached or not</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000000>3. Required materials, documents, reference bibliography</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>What, where, when</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000000>4. Presentation or contents</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Development of the training activity</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000000>5. Review</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Recap (this will be the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> time that the contents are repeated for the participants benefit)</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000000>6. Hands-on labs or exercises (if it applies)</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Description. Trainers help participants.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000000>7. Summary</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Brief summary and conclusions</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000000>8. Self Evaluation (few “hot” questions”)</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>No more than 5-6 questions about the most important topics. Here the participants have the opportunity to review the whole module at their own pace. Trainers help participants to find the required information to answer the questions. About 10-15 minutes should be allocated here. After this, participant states her/his assessment of the objective’s accomplishment. </P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000000>9. Public questions and answers (they will come when people tries to answer the questions)</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Public debate on remarkable questions and interesting matters</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000000>10. Module or Topic assessment by participants (Standard form)</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>This is the right moment to do it. If the forms are distributed at the end of the workshop, it is very difficult to remember each and every presentation, module, or exercise.</P>
<P>The feedback form should include the participant’s own assessment on success for each of the specific topics.</P>
<P><A name=_Toc127080070></A><A name=_Toc126426206></A><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Evaluation</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>In every course, evaluation has different objectives:</P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>To give an opportunity to recap and review all the learning items on a topic. People realize what they have learnt and what not when they are faced with the proper questions, and have to answer them on their own. 
<LI>To analyze if the course is having the intended effect on the participants. What we search for here is a figure, for each module, representing the learning process effectiveness. So, using this information and the modules feedback and navigation meetings, it is possible to improve the course. 
<LI>People need to know how well they are performing. In our Training Workshops context, people would be interested in testing or verifying if they have reached an appropriate knowledge and skills level. That could be done via self-evaluations. </LI></UL></UL>
<P><A name=_Toc127080071></A><A name=_Toc126426207></A><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>How to do it</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>It is recommended to do a recap of all the concepts at the end of the module or topic presentation. </P>
<P>After the recap, it would be nice to have a personal self-evaluation, using just a few key questions (no more than 5-6). While answering the questions, participants would be supported by the trainers. This activity could be about 10-15 minutes long. </P>
<P>At the end of this activity, each participant should be faced again with the Module or Topic Objective (as shown at the beginning of the Module) and should ask the following question: </P>
<P><STRONG>To what degree do you think you have attained the module’s objective?</STRONG> </P>
<P>Please take this into account when fulfilling the Module Feeback Form. </P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Evaluation and Assessment</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><I>"Evaluation builds in rigor. It<PERSONNAME>'</PERSONNAME>s an integral part of the whole quality effort. If you don<PERSONNAME>'</PERSONNAME>t measure, how do you know whether what you<PERSONNAME>'</PERSONNAME>ve done is worthwhile?" </I></P>
<P>Training and development staff are becoming more and more accountable for the effectiveness of their programs. Evaluation can be used to determine whether the training achieves its objectives. Evaluation can also assess the value of the training, identify improvement areas, and identify unnecessary training that can be eliminated. Even though Evaluation is listed as the last item in the training workshop, evaluation actually takes place throughout the workshop. </P>
<P>Many training professionals agree that evaluation is important to successful training, but few conduct complete and thorough evaluations. Typically evaluation is an afterthought or not done at all.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of evaluation methodology that are recommended. One is the use of a questionnaire and one is in the form of navigation meetings. Both these sections will be covered in depth under the various sections.</P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Evaluation Questionnaire</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>An evaluation questionnaire is designed to get feedback from the participants in a formal manner. Although, during the course of the training, the instructor will be observing on the comments and feedback, this form of assessment provides answers to some very specific areas that the trainer might want covered.</P>
<P>A sample questionnaire can be downloaded from section “<STRONG>Available Resources<I>” .</I></STRONG>and this form has already been used in a training setting. You should note the following points.</P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>The evaluation form should be simple and have direct questions rather than open-ended ones. 
<LI>Make the questionnaire simple and easy to use. 
<LI>Participants names should be omitted in order to encourage them to give their honest feedback. </LI></UL></UL>
<P>The questions are rated on a scale of 1 to 5, which allows a simple way to judge the various activities. The results can then be tabulated and analyzed. </P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Navigation Meetings</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>In order to get a daily feedback and to allow the instructor to change, modify or alter the training schedule, Navigation Meetings should be carried out on a daily basis. This enables the instructor to get an insight on how the training is progressing and if there are any major areas of concern that need to be addressed early on rather than later.</P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>During the first session, a series of groups will be formed from the participants. 
<LI>The groups should be as mixed as possible and should not number more that 5 nor less than 2. 
<LI>The participants will be instructed to appoint a representative for that day only. 
<LI>At the end of the day the participants will meet in their own groups and list out the main points of what went well and what did not. 
<LI>The group leader will take notes and will bring these points forward when he will attend a meeting later with the instructor team. 
<LI>During the meeting with the instructor team, each representative from the group will give one positive and one negative feedback of the day. If a point has been covered by another group, then this should be skipped. 
<LI>The instructor will be taking notes and will have to make the necessary alterations to the training, room, facilities etc if any. 
<LI>The following day, one member from the group leaders will summarize the navigation meeting. 
<LI>For the next day, the group should appoint a new representative and the procedure is followed throughout the course. </LI></UL></UL>
<P>A major advantage of these navigation meetings is that any issues are addressed quite quickly and the instructor does not have to wait for feedback right at the end and can only make changes in the next training workshop.</P>
<P>It is important to note that the trainer(s) should take the feedback constructively and adapt to any changes that are pointed out. The trainer should realize that in order to have an effective training session the concerns of the participants have to be addressed</P>
