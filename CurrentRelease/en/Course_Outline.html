<P><STRONG>Introduction</STRONG></P>
<P>We designed this manual to provide as much hands-on training as possible for the participants. A major emphasis is given on labs/case studies. We cannot stress enough that it is very important to allow the participants enough time to practice the sessions. The trainer should allow the use of the lab after training hours for those participants who would like to practice or improve their skills on the computer. Keep in mind that most of the time you will have to deal with a very variable audience, with different interests and levels of CPB and IT knowledge and skills. So you will have to take that into account when planning the agenda, particularly for the labs sections.</P>
<P><A name=_Toc127080061></A><STRONG>Time </STRONG><A name=_Toc126426197></A><STRONG>Table</STRONG></P>
<P>The recommended course time-table is for a 5 day workshop. This will have 2 full days, followed by a third half-day, and then 2 full days. The participants will be given a “break” with some time-off, half-way through the workshop. This will allow better participation from the students.</P>
<P>There should be scheduled tea breaks and lunch times. The trainer will have to ensure that the time is managed appropriately and strict start and end times are maintained to ensure that trainees do not spend time or energy worrying about time and stomachs.</P>
<P>A sample time table can be downloaded from section “<STRONG>Available Resources<I>”.</I></STRONG></P>
<P><A name=_Toc127080062></A><A name=_Toc126426198></A><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Modules</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>The training course is designed in modules covering the major areas of the workshop. The modules are interspaced with hands-on lab work and a lot of time is allocated for the case study work. The tools that are required for each of the modules are listed in the relevant sections. This provides a quick check-list of what are the most appropriate tools to help conduct the module.</P>
<P><STRONG>Stakeholder modules</STRONG></P>
<P>These modules comprise a set of cohesive training subunits. The training subunits are self-contained, which means that different components can be put together in various formats suitable for different target audiences. </P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Interactive modules</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>There are two interactive modules for the workshop. These are designed to enable the participants to understand the concepts in a hands-on manner. The modules are designed in Macromedia Flash and are very intuitive to use. These modules would be installed locally, their execution through the internet is not recommended as the size hence the required speed is too large. The modules are contained on the CD, and will be available for downloading, too.</P>
<P><A name=_Toc127080064></A><A name=_Toc126426200></A><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Case Studies</STRONG> </FONT></P>
<P>There are several case studies that can be used during the training workshop. The participants will be allowed time after the relevant modules to complete these. The case studies will enable the participants to get hand-on experience and get comfortable with the interface, the options, and techniques to use the BCH.</P>
<P>The first and second case studies are simple to manage and are just introductory. The following ones are intended to exercise all the BCH Central Portal functionality with respect to registering users and information and are slightly more complex. This needs to be handled very carefully. More details are given in the relevant sections.</P>
